      So why? Why, despite much scientific and technologic progress, is medicine still so ineffectual? The failure of medicine to make a meaningful positive difference to the health of humanity is systemic. Although medicine - and the health care system in which it is embedded - is a mosaic made of many interests, many of which are wholly at odds with one another, its structural flaws are fundamentally philosophical. Although there are indeed many vested interests that pervert the effective functioning of the medical enterprise, the issue with the way we seek to procure health and manage disease runs much deeper. Indeed, it represents a variety of ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions, whether they’re simply implicit in how things are structured, or explicitly acknowledged and very much on the surface. 
<br></br><br></br>
While it might sound a bit dramatic, it’s worth pointing out that it’s true almost by definition. If medicine is largely ineffective, even mildly sub-optimal, it is so because of the ideas, values and beliefs - aka the stuff of philosophy - it embodies. Therefore, any failing is fundamentally philosophical. Moreover, if medicine was the embodiment of any kind of “enlightened philosophy” we would expect, by definition, enlightened outcomes. Our health care system, of which medicine is the backbone, is many things. ‘Enlightened’ is not one of them. 
<br></br><br></br>
The model of modern medicine can be understood, as scientist-physician-philosopher Siddhartha Mukherjee noted, as consisting of three steps:
<br></br><br></br>
	1. Have disease<br></br>
	2. Take pill<br></br>
	3. Kill something<br></br>
    <br></br><br></br>
Now there is nothing prima facie wrong with this model. In fact it seems perfectly reasonable: take a physical problem, treat it with something, be done with it. It appears less reasonable, however, when considered it in light of the astonishing complexity of the human condition. At any given moment, there are billions of physiological reactions taking place. The entire modern pharmacopeia - the whole pharmaceutical kitchen sink - contains drugs targeted at approximately 250 of these. As a percentage, for you mathematicians and numberphiles, it works out to be rather small. Like, really small. Really really really small. Yep, that small. To be clear, that means of the billions of things that could possibly be going wrong at any given moment, we have tools for affecting a few hundred of them. Admittedly, the picture is a little more complicated than this. Although we only have drugs targeted at a few hundred of the total physiological reactions, given the interconnectedness/interdependency of biological systems, including our own, these drugs would modulate far more than a few hundred reactions. The essential fact remains, however, that pharmaceutical interventions represent a drop in the vast ocean of human physiology. 

<br></br><br></br>

The lack of efficacy of modern medical interventions therefore reflects, in large part, the complexity of the object of intervention - the human body - and the highly reductive, grossly oversimplified means by which we attempt to intervene in said complexity. Why, then, do we do what we do? Why, if it’s such an uphill battle, do we persist in attempting to treat disease in such a manner? The first and most obvious reason for our ‘disease-pill-kill’ model is purely pragmatic. People get sick, and when they do, we are - or at least we feel we are - obliged to do something. While it would of course be preferable if disease were never to manifest in the first place, the reality is that, from time-to-time it does. And since what we are is chemistry, it stands to reason that any disease state is also, at root, a problem of chemistry. Ipso facto we should therefore treat chemistry with chemistry. Plus, what could be more convenient? Have disease - take pill - kill something; the appeal is self-evident. So intoxicating of an idea, it almost sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it? 
<br></br><br></br>
Of course the punchline is that it is too good to be true. “Medical nihilism” isn’t a term of endorsement, after all. That it’s too good to be true isn’t the surprising - nor interesting - piece of this, though. Instead, that it’s effective even at all is a remarkable fact, both in terms of what it implies about what it is that we are, as well as our own ability to modulate whatever that is. The most salient example of the effectiveness of pharmaceutical intervention is obviously the invention of penicillin in the early 20th century and its subsequent use against a variety of infectious disease. That from a strain of mould grown in a petrie dish it would be possible to isolate a compound and then administer it to such profound effect - saving millions of lives - is itself an astonishing, most unlikely fact of our existence. Were it not so patently the case, it would be genuinely unbelievable. And yet it is the case. The discovery of penicillin and its application has saved innumerable lives, while simultaneously altering our conception of what we are as things/entities/organisms. But it hasn’t come for free. The “germ theory of disease” paradigm ushered in by the antibiotic revolution has enabled us to turn what were once life-ending ailments into entirely benign and treatable conditions. Unfortunately, however, it’s also directly led to the establishment of a “philosophy of medicine” that is, in practice, largely antithetical to the aim of human health. 
<br></br><br></br>
So while the use of antibiotics to treat disease might seem like the real-world equivalent of a fairytale, it’s not the kind that ends happily-ever-after (at least not if the story ends here). Although it started out as one of humanity’s great moral victories, the scientific/philosophical paradigm that emerged from penicillin’s success is proving highly pernicious. So, what is this paradigm? 
<br></br><br></br>
In broad strokes, the idea that defines the practice of modern medicine, an idea apparently affirmed by the “germ theory of disease”, is that disease states are fundamentally products of microphysiological processes, and as such, it is at this level that they are best understood and intervened on. If the central dogma of molecular biology is the role of DNA in the biological flow of information (DNA encodes RNA which makes a protein), this is the central dogma of modern medicine. Although this perspective seems harmless - perhaps even true - enough, implicit in this kind of reductionism is a deep and by no means self-evident set of philosophical assumptions. For one, it implies a very interesting ontology: that is, that biological systems are, in essence, constituted by nothing but molecules and their interactions. Even if it’s not explicitly acknowledged, it’s tacitly assumed by proponents of this kind of reductionism that these lower-level processes are somehow more “real” - certainly vested with more causal power - than their higher-level counterparts. This is what’s known as ontological reduction, and it’s the default ontology of modern medicine. 
<br></br><br></br>
<em>
“If the central dogma of molecular biology is X, the central dogma of biology today is that everything there is to be known about a given biological systems is to be known by way of their genes.”</em>
<br></br><br></br>
	- Musashi 
    <br></br><br></br>
Accordingly, since What We Are is nothing but a collection of chemical interactions, it follows that higher-level features of our organism - our experience, for instance - should in principle be reduced to these lower-level, chemical processes. And not only should higher-level features be reduced to lower-level processes, it’s taken as a given that they can in practice. This is what’s known as epistemological reduction; the belief that higher-level processes can be understood in terms of lower-level ones. From this, it’s only a very small hop skip and a jump to the next level of reductionism, arguably the most salient feature of modern medicine: methodological reduction - the belief that, not only can higher-level processes be understood in terms of their lower-level parts, it is at these lower-levels that any system - here, biological systems - is most fruitfully investigated. 

<br></br><br></br>

Together, these three beliefs form what we may refer to as “full-stack reductionism,” the philosophical superstructure in which modern medicine is practiced. At the level of scientific investigation, it’s a conceptual/philosophical framework that’s proven impressively valuable. Consider the success of modern physics. More germanely, in the field of biology, the reductionist program is responsible for the sub-field known as ‘molecular biology’, which directly led to the elucidation of DNA, the sequencing of the human genome and thus the “genetic/genomic revolution” we are currently living amidst. Importantly, these scientific discoveries have also translated to the field of medicine, leading to new and novel forms of effective treatment. So it’s a productive paradigm, no doubt. Hence its favour. For all its strengths, however, the reductionist paradigm - in the context of medicine, specifically - also has its deficiencies, deficiencies that have manifested themselves in the form of our highly ineffective health care system. 
<br></br><br></br>

To begin with, the view that ‘disease is the result of microphysiological processes’ - aka the biomedical reductionist creed - lends itself to a kind of medical myopia, where we study/fine-grain the particular molecular instantiations of the perceived problem, at the expense of understanding the broader context in which the disease state arose. While we might gain some level of understanding into the molecular underpinnings that are associated/correlated with the disease state in question, we rarely gain any genuine insight into its actual etiology. In many respects, it only abstracts us further from the underlying cause, for we forget that the microphysiological process/dysfunction is the product of interactions taking place inside the broader context of a body which itself exists within the context of a world - our world. A most incredulous example of how this affects medical research is in the use of animal models, specifically, in the field of oncology. The dominant paradigm in cancer research is the study of mice. We take mice, infect them with cancer, and then study what goes down. Remarkably, however, many of the forms of cancer we study don’t occur naturally in mice at all.   We therefore take a fundamentally human disease, literally force it into a non-human model, study its dynamics, convince ourselves we’ve figured it out, then invariably find ourselves deflated/perplexed when the findings don’t translate - and they almost never do - to humans. And yet we wonder why, 50 years and $500 billion later, we still don’t understand the roots of cancer
<br></br><br></br>
<em>
A disheartening fact that nags me constantly is that despite spending more than $500 billion on cancer since 1971, which amounts to $50 billion per year or $20,000 per cancer patient who died in the past forty years, we were—and are still—uncertain about the roots of cancer. (“The First Cell”) 
</em>
<br></br><br></br>
Our fixation on microphysiological processes, and the ontological status we assign to them, greatly precludes us from understanding the broader causal dynamics of disease. Our medicines are largely ineffectual because we are intervening in the proximate causes of disease, rather than their ultimate or underlying bases. In many instances, we are intervening merely at the level of symptoms. Enamoured by the minutia of the trees we forget the essential fact of the forest. Until we reckon with the high-level, systematic interplay between body and world, we will never truly understand health or disease. 
<br></br><br></br>
In order to understand the existing medical paradigm, it’s helpful to understand a bit about the history of biology. While medicine is not a new science, biology - as we know it - is. Today, the two disciplines are as one.
