      Of course, very few philosophers/physicians/people would disagree with the notion of prevention, in principle, nor would they contend the claim that there are causal forces operating before the dysfunction of a molecular process associated with any given disease state. Be that as it may, however, the bias towards reduction in biomedical science inevitably causes us to place less of an emphasis on the broader context of disease. A health care system that prioritises treatment over prevention is, in other words, a natural consequence of reductionism. Sick care is, in effect, nothing but an institutional embodiment of medical reductionism. 

If reductionism is so unambiguously stupid, why, then, is it the dominant medical paradigm? Well firstly, reductionism isn’t stupid. On the contrary, it’s a powerful epistemological/methodological framework for advancing our understanding of the world, in medicine and beyond. This fact is beyond refute. The problem lies when it’s carried too far, when it’s taken to be the only effective way of doing things. So the question is not, why reductionism at all? But rather, why reductionism above all else? While we have already explored some of the philosophical assumptions that underpin reductionism’s predominance, there are many other factors, including pragmatic, economic, and even sociological/psychological forces that are responsible for its immense influence in the field of medicine. Although a comprehensive - let alone exhaustive - analysis of the philosophy and practice of reductionism in medicine is beyond the scope of this book, it’s worthwhile examining some of the more ‘causally significant’ dynamics. 

As alluded to above, the success of reductionism in other fields of science, namely physics, has a lot to do with its current dominance in medicine. Reductionism simply works and that’s a fact. It’s ‘scientifically proven,’ as it were. Although it’s been successful almost across the board, to varying degrees, nowhere has reductionism been more demonstrably productive than in the field of physics. Physics, in a certain sense, is the science of reductionism. The whole enterprise is literally predicated upon reducing systems to their component parts. Things (objects), physics taught us, are made of things (molecules) which are made of things (atoms) which are, in turn, also made of things (elementary particles). By putting reductionism to work, physics gave us the modern world. It is only natural, therefore, that we would try and put it to work across the other branches of knowledge. And so we have. But biology isn’t physics, and it never will be. Though biological systems might be entirely consonant with the laws of physics, they cannot be understood in terms of them. For biological systems are systems defined by their emergent complexity, their ‘multi-layeredness’. Even if we were to know everything there is to know about any given biological system at the level of atoms, we would only know about one level, one dimension, of that organism. That is, we wouldn’t know it at all. 

￼

To be clear, there aren’t many claiming that all we need in order to understand ourselves is a complete account of the interactions between molecules at any given moment. But this has less to do with any fundamental philosophical objection to the idea and more to do with the pragmatic fact that we never will have such a description. If such a description were provided, whether by Laplace’s Demon or another obliging omniscient entity, all currently open questions within biology would be put to bed - so it goes. A complete physico-chemical account of a biological system would, according to the ‘anti-emergentist’ camp, amount to a full account period. Now folks do believe that.[ Whether or not a strong reductionist believes this will largely depend on their position on / interpretation of quantum mechanics and the role of quantum mechanics in biological systems.] Quantum mechanical complications aside, the problem with Laplace’s Demon, in the realm of biology, is that its predictive/explanatory power is predicated on the existence of only one type of causation: that is, bottom-up. In other words, atoms affect molecules which affect tissues which affect organs which affect organisms - and not the other way round. However, there is good reason (if not good reason, certainly reason) to believe that the kind of bottom-up causation that is the hallmark of ‘simple’ and ‘closed’ physical systems - i.e. the domain of physics - is not the only causal force at work within ‘complex’ and ‘open’ systems - i.e. the realm of biology. Indeed it appears likely that ‘top-down’ causal forces are also at play within life, the equivalent of physical laws exerting influence at every level of hierarchical organisation, that cannot - neither in principle nor in practice - be reduced to their underlying microscopic processes. Rather than atoms and molecules, it has been suggested that the true language of biological systems - and the source of top-down causation - is information. Informational properties are of course a defining characteristic of biological systems. Think DNA. Thus the issue is not whether information is an inherent quality of biological systems, but rather whether they feature - prominently, or at all - in their causal dynamics. If information is in fact an emergent causal force, then the attempt to understand biological systems in terms of their molecular interactions will ultimately prove futile (if it hasn’t already), and will eventually be superseded by the use of alternative - most likely computational - concepts. To be sure, this is an open question; it’s not clear to what degree (if at all) information exerts causal influence over matter. If it does, however, it would at least partially explain the poor efficacy of the majority of existing medical interventions, while suggesting a possible, more productive path forward.[ Computational systems biology (CSB) is already an emerging field within biology. It is promising. Provide some interesting info as footnote. ] 

While there’s a definite philosophical logic behind reductionism, it’s by no means the only reason for its near-monopoly over the scientific - and by extension, medical - enterprise. Indeed, although there’s an ongoing and genuinely legitimate debate concerning the epistemic limits of reductionism, a debate which the reductionists are evidently winning, the dominance of reductionism - within the field of medicine, specifically - arguably has very little to do with it. In reality, far more mundane factors are at work. For one, economics. As is readily appreciable, a health care system oriented towards treatment is far more lucrative than one optimised for prevention. It is no coincidence, therefore, that what we have is the former. It is no coincidence, either, that the predominant treatment paradigm - the dispensing of drugs - is one perfectly aligned with the economic interests of its predominant interest: the pharmaceutical industry. A world where no-one gets sick is, quite simply, a world where no-one makes money from sickness. 

Now this is not to say that everyone working within the pharmaceutical industry, or health care more broadly, are malicious greedy bastards leveraging human suffering for self-gain, charlatans selling hope pills in exchange for cash. Nor is it to suggest that economic interest is the only incentive driving the medical industry. Of course, there are many highly compassionate, well-intentioned individuals working within, or at the periphery of, the medical industry who are genuinely concerned with alleviating human suffering, with making the world a better place. The fact remains, however, that the most powerful force within health care is indeed economic interest, and therefore, the most powerful force within health is, by virtue of the industry’s economic dynamics, fundamentally misaligned with humanity’s best interests, not to mention the supposed aim of health care: our health. 

Developing a medical system - and indeed society - that truly accords with humanity’s health, in the face of an economic logic that demonstrably perverts that end, will no doubt be one of the great challenges of the 21st century. Since the incentives of incumbent players are greatly at odds with our best interests, and given the ties between Big Industry and government, our prospects are largely dependent upon the intellectual and entrepreneurial dynamism of mission-driven organisations, and their efforts to develop new products, services and economic models that prioritise prediction, prevention and optimisation over the existing ‘slash-poison-burn’ model of treatment. Of course, much work will be done - and needs to be done - wholly outside of the economic sphere; whether that be on the public policy (public health) side of things, or on the cultural/educational front. Creating a healthier planet will, it should go without saying, require the effective coordination of the whole of our collective resources. Health, after all, is the human project; that which we all participate in. 

 The reductionist bias, in medicine as in science generally, is also a reflection of the institutional structures within which science takes place and the broader cultural trends which shaped them. Since the dawn of the scientific revolution, some hundreds of years ago, the university campus has been the principle setting of science. Among the modern university’s more salient features, certainly the most pertinent to any understanding of modern science, is the division/separation between academic departments. Physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, art, history, philosophy, politics, economics etc. Each subject or field of inquiry has their own buildings, their own faculties, their own distinct ways of viewing the world. And for the most part, they keep to themselves. Physicists do physics, chemists do chemistry and so on and so forth, with very little talk between them. Every now and then, some idea may spill over from one discipline into the other, but for the most part, they exist as intellectual islands unto themselves. The left hand rarely talks to the right. While the neat separation of academic disciplines represents, on one hand, the intellectual impulse to categorise and classify - to make order of an otherwise chaotic world - it also reflects the more prosaic and overarching societal shift towards specialisation. Where once upon a time, a single human mind could comprehend the totality of human knowledge, today, even the most gifted, voracious mind can fathom only the most modest sliver. Accordingly, we have taken to “specialising,” that is, picking a narrow field of inquiry and pursuing it as far as one can, in the hope of adding a single leaf to the great tree of knowledge. Rather than breadth, we’ve opted for depth. Whether it be ultimately Good or Bad, specialisation is merely a pragmatic response to the rapid and concurrent growth in both information and population. 

To the degree that specialisation’s a problem, it’s an awfully glamorous one; that we can’t know all there is to know is, after all, the direct consequence of the extraordinary historical success of the Knowledge Project. First world problem though it might be, it remains a legitimate problem nonetheless. On the individual level, we’re each having to learn to reconcile the abundance of information with the reality of our highly manipulable - and therefore increasingly scarce - stores of attention. We are confronted daily by the paradox of choice, forced to negotiate the finitude of our lives with the seeming infinitude of things to do, watch, be. In terms of our careers, in order to render ourselves economically valuable, we are seemingly obliged to choose a highly specialised technical/epistemic niche - accounting, software engineering, law, construction, medicine etc. - or else risk the abyss of uncertainty that is the ‘non-conventional’, or God forbid, ‘creative’ path. How we navigate this single decision, in the 21st century, is, in many ways, what defines us. We are either ‘professionals’ who followed the well-defined specialist track, or defiant (and likely poor) non-conformists who opted for generality, or if not generality, speciality of our own choosing. 

In terms of how we do science, specialisation - for all its practical advantages - creates boundaries where, in reality, no such boundaries exist. Nowhere is this more harmful than in the field of biology. Although there are legitimate differences between the fields of physics, chemistry and biology - not to mention art, history, and philosophy - the distinctions we draw between them have more to do with the commercial realities and subsequent architecture of universities and the bandwidth constraints of any individual career, and less to do with any real, underlying epistemic separation. By drawing lines in the sand, we arbitrarily define our object of inquiry, rendering us blind to insights that may exist beyond the gaze of our magnifying glass. The study of biological systems, as inherently transcdisciplinary phenomena, is perhaps uniquely hindered by the historical fragmentation of knowledge. For the study of ourselves, specifically, requires engaging with the totality of our existence, from the physical facts of our organism, right up to the psychological and cultural phenomena that emerge from them. Each level of emergent phenomena has insight to impart on the next, inexorably tied and epistemically equivalent as they are[ Share story about the work of Geoffrey West and his scaling laws. Concrete example of the interconnectedness of phenomena, the unity of knowledge. ]. Understanding life - in all its complexity - will require our bringing to bear upon the subject the entirety of human understanding, tools, and techniques. It will require, in other words, the dissolution of artificial epistemic constructs; physicists, philosophers, psychologists, poets, computer scientists, historians, economists, anthropologists, and mathematicians all working together in unison. For there is only one Nature, after all, only we make of her many.

There is another, related reason why reductionism holds such sway over the scientific enterprise. That is, simply, that we know how to do it. Reductionism is a model that’s not only demonstrably effective, but well defined. In other words, we know how to reduce things to their constituent parts. We know how to study mechanisms, reduce complexity to simplicity. Thus we reduce because we know how, because we can. Moreover, it’s not immediately obvious how complex phenomena would be understood in any other way. If it’s complexity that makes a thing hard to comprehend, then it stands to reason, or so it would seem, that the only way to study said thing is by breaking it down, rendering it simpler. While this works, to a degree, too often we find ourselves substituting complexity for simplicity, at the expense of understanding - simply (no pun intended) because it’s easier. As complexity scientist/philosopher David Krakauer noted, “one of the great curses of the history of human intellection is simple thinking. Finding simplicity where it does not exist.” The way we have structured our education system is a reflection of this kind of intellectual crutch. Rather than engaging with phenomena in their natural state of complexity, we abstract their constituent features and study them in isolation. This is the dark side of reductionism. What transpires is a state of affairs where we can describe ad nauseam a system’s components, but exhibit very little genuine understanding (as measured in terms of, say, our ability to control a system). The field of economics is a perfect example. Despite being one of the most well-funded ‘sciences’, and despite having produced a bona fide mountain of literature, economics has to date provided us with next-to-no predictive power, let alone reliable ability to intervene. Medicine is, of course, another great example. Where Moore’s law describes the doubling of computational power roughly every 2 years since 1970, Emoore’s law (Moore’s law reversed) describes how drug discovery since the 1980s has become more expensive, slowed down delivery of drugs to those in need, and produced largely ineffective and on the whole doubtful remedies. [ World’s hidden in plain sight (page 351)] Clearly, something about our approach isn’t working; and, similarly clear, our failure to make progress outside of the physical sciences - progress comparable to that of the physics - has much to do with our lack of a methodological framework for understanding/investigating complex, adaptive systems, and our current ‘one-size-fits-all’ to knowledge acquisition. If any of this holds true, the challenge of the 21st century, and the challenge of 21st century medicine/biology, will be learning to reckon with complexity, fully, without defaulting to simplicity.
