      From this philosophy of biology/medicine, an entire system of health care follows. What began as a  set of purely abstract premises for understanding the world, has thus manifested in the form of a highly tangible methodology for doing research and tending to one another, in sickness and in health (but mostly in sickness). <br></br><br></br>

At the level of society, reductionist medical science - medicine’s implicit epistemology/ontology - translates to a very particular model of health care. Since the preferred level of causal explanation is micro-mechanisms, it is also - naturally enough - the preferred level of intervention. This is entirely logical. For if disease is taken to be ‘fundamentally’ the result of dysfunction taking place at the molecular level, it should follow that interventions should act on the molecular level. However, while it might seem reasonable enough, in principle, it also implies a medical system predicated on treatment, rather than prevention; a system which, as it happens, is highly sub-optimal - to put it mildly. <br></br><br></br>

Just think about it. If we accept that disease is the product of dysfunction (is dysfunction) taking place at the molecular level, it follows that, so long as we can ascertain what exactly that dysfunction is, and so long as we can design a chemical fix for that particular dysfunction, we can treat it (by definition). In such a case, it is perfectly logical to invest a great deal of resources into understanding and investigating the molecular processes underpinning disease states in order to design or develop interventions for treating them. Treatment, in other words, is an entirely logical extension of medical reductionism. Indeed, it’s the only paradigm that makes sense. If, however, you take a non-reductive view of disease - and consider molecular dysfunctions to be merely proximate causes (or correlates) of disease - such emphasis on low-level processes - i.e. molecules/genes - appears far less sensible. Instead, the emphasis would be on ascertaining the ‘ultimate’ cause of disease, at whatever level of emergence, so that it may be addressed/treated directly. Within the non-reductive framework, higher and lower-level processes are on equal epistemic footing. The principle difference between the reductive and non-reductive approach to disease is that the latter views disease in its broader context, its ‘bio-pyscho-social’ context, rather than something that takes place in a physiological vacuum. Within this framework, prevention (as opposed to treatment) is both possible and preferred. 
<br></br><br></br>
Due to its emphasis on treatment, our existing health care system is often referred to as “sick care”.  Since disease states can only be ‘treated’ once they’ve arisen, we spend enormous sums of resources developing, diagnosing and ultimately ‘medicating’ them - to very little, and often adverse, effect. Through the non-reductive lens, this is entirely unsurprising. For what we are doing is not treating the cause of the disease state, merely its symptoms. Disease, within a more holistic framing, is the end result of a long, multivariate, and thus invariably complex causal chain. By the time the disease is manifest, nature has an inertia that is extraordinarily difficult to bend, irrespective of how powerful the medicine. Accordingly, the most effective point of intervention is earlier along the causal chain, before the disease has arisen, towards its ultimate point of origin. Thus “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” as the adage goes. It’s this kind of holistic perspective that instilled in Hippocrates (or whoever was writing on his behalf) the medical/epistemic modesty expressed in the following aphorisms: ‘Natural forces are the healers of disease’, and ‘As to diseases, make a habit of two things - to help, or at least do no harm’.[ I know what you thinking “yeh yeh, but we’re no longer living in ancient times. We are modern. We have conquered the world. We are all-knowing. We are tech savvy. The point here is not that we are incapable of mastering our own physiology but rather that, going by the data, we are not there yet. If we are to make progress, we must be honest in assessing where we are mistaken. What are the assumptions that have gone unchallenged? How can we change things? What new perspective will advance us forward? ] William Osler, a late-great giant of modern medicine, expressed a similar sentiment: “One of the first duties of the physician is to educate the masses not to take medicine”. Medical nihilism - or something like it - is thus not a new phenomenon, nor is it a rebuke of medicine as an enterprise. Presumably, neither Osler nor Hippocrates before him practiced medicine because they thought it was a sham, but rather because they believed in its potential. Their statements are not expressions of medicine’s futility, simply humble acknowledgements of the power of nature and our limited comprehension of it, and thus, our ability to control its whims. And though we’ve come a long way, the fundamental dynamics of this epistemic relationship - between man and nature - have changed very little. Yes, we might have translated a few more of its pages, yet we remain overwhelmingly ignorant of the Big Book of Nature. Medical nihilism is thus a reflection of this fact, but it’s a contingent fact, that is one that’s subject to change. Indeed, medical nihilism implies nothing about the ultimate capacity or potential of medicine, construed broadly enough, to deliver us a healthier world. Rather, it is simply a reaction, based on the evidence, to the ‘philosophy of treatment’ and its historical performance/consequences. Though the past and present instills a sense of nihilism, the future is long and unknown. Nihilism may, in the end, turn to optimism. The past is not the future, and the future, whenever it comes, is prevention.
