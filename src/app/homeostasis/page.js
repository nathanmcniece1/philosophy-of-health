      Health as homeostasis provides us with a very different conceptual picture. Instead of viewing health and sickness as two distinct modes or states, each being defined by the absence of the other, through the homeostatic lens we see health as a kind of dynamic equilibrium, a physiological sweet-spot of sorts, an island of optimal function surrounded by a sea of sickness (that is, non-optimal function). It’s quite a remarkable idea when you think about it. Within any human being at any given time, there’s an inordinate number (trillions at the very least, but who really knows) of physiological processes taking place, processes at every level of emergence — cells, tissues, organs — processes that make life possible. Each of these processes has an optimal range of function, somewhere between too much and too little, too fast and too slow. And health is the emergent phenomenon that manifests when most or all of these processes are within the optimal range. Sickness, on the other hand, is what emerges when enough of these processes are outside — or well outside — the optimal range, that it shifts the entire organism out of homeostasis and into disequilibrium. Sickness, in this sense, is disequilibrium, dysfunction.<br></br><br></br>

To be sure, homeostasis is not some purely intellectual concept. Rather it’s a very tangible component of modern medicine. Consider, for example, the routine check-up. One visits their local general practitioner — someone trained to view the human organism from a thousand feet — who seeks to ascertain a much about their health status as possible. This usually involves the patient having their blood pressure taken and having blood drawn, the results of which both serve as proxies for the state of a great deal of physiological processes, the latter providing a far more comprehensive and detailed picture. Depending on whether or not the patient’s results fall within the healthy or “normal” range — a range defined in terms of established norms for particular reference classes (age, sex etc.) — the doctor will either assure the patient that all is good, or look to correct — with some kind of intervention — what appears to be dysfunctional (abnormal hormone levels, for instance). In a nutshell, this is how we do medicine in the 21st century.<br></br><br></br>

According to homeostatic thought, perfect health must be perfect homeostasis. Perfect balance. Perfect equilibrium. Perfect alignment. Perfect function. Every physiological process doing what it should precisely when it should. The picture this idea paints is one of a kind of finely-tuned machine, or perhaps a highly efficient manufactory, perfectly organised biological chaos. As sound as this idea seems, does it really capture all that it means to be healthy? Or is there more to the concept of health than mere biological balance?<br></br><br></br>

It doesn’t take much reflection to appreciate that there must be more to health than homeostasis. Consider, for example, congenital blindness, or any other ‘benign’ congenital disease. Despite being born without eyesight, it seems possible that one may nevertheless find themselves in a state of perfect homeostasis. In other words, blindness does not necessarily imply physiological imbalance. To be blind is to simply be without a particular attribute. What’s inherently unhealthy about the absence of a particular attribute if it doesn’t interfere with homeostasis? Now one could argue that sight is a vital part of our homeostatic machinery, thus being without it would surely have undesirable biological — that is, homeostatic — implications. In practice, this is almost certainly true. Being without vision would, one imagines, make things a hell of a lot harder. However, there is nothing in principle to suggest that blindness must impede homeostasis. It’s even conceivable that blindness could, in some contexts, prove homeostatically beneficial. For instance, if blindness lead one to have certain insights about what is important in life or what is truly valuable about our humanity, those insights could well be extremely conducive to homeostasis. In any case, let’s assume that it’s possible to be both blind and in a state of perfect homeostasis. If so, how then could we claim that it’s somehow ‘less healthy’ to be blind than to have perfect vision? All other things being equal, what makes having eyesight ‘healthier’ than not? If we can’t appeal to homeostasis, how could we justify this claim? Or is it simply non-sensical to speak of health in terms of anything other than biological homeostasis?<br></br><br></br>

As I’ve already suggested, there has to be more to an enlightened conception of health than mere homeostasis. As I’ll argue, we are perfectly justified in preferring vision to blindness, all things being equal. Moreover, not only are we justified in preferring vision to blindness, we are also justified in claiming that it’s healthier to have eyesight than to not.<br></br><br></br>
