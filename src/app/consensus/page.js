      Take a room full of people and ask them how they feel about the notion of living forever. “Oh no absolutely not, that sounds horrible” — or some approximation thereof — is the likely to be the mean response. “Well, what about living to 200, how does that sound?”. The room would be slightly less squeamish but nevertheless still deeply uncomfortable with the idea. Now ask the room how they’d feel about the prospect of dying tomorrow, next week, next month, or, for that matter, next year. The response? Sheer terror. <br></br><br></br>

Now what are we to make of all this? While we have an intuition that dying tomorrow would be a tragedy, we take a very different view of what it would mean to do some distant number of years in the future. Death is bad, if it’s tomorrow, but good if it happens far enough away from the present moment? Is that the intuition? Sure seems strange.<br></br><br></br>

Ultimately, when you break it down, very few people are actually averse to the idea of living for a good while longer than is presently normal, or even indefinitely. What most people are responding to, when posed the question, is some notion of the end of life drawn out to infinity. As in, 100 years old, immobile, sick, dependent — only forever. Of course that would be horrible. <br></br><br></br>

But what about 200 years of living as a 25 year old, the epitome of mental and physical health? Would that really be so bad? Now what about immortality in this context?<br></br><br></br>

Here I will argue that, contrary to the conventional reaction to the prospect of radical longevity or immortality, more Life is, on the whole, better — provided that the quality of Life is good, provided, that is, that we’re healthy. I will make this case from logic, relate it to the philosophy of health, before dissecting the popular aversions people have to the idea of a life much longer than we are yet to know.
