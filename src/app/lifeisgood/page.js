      Having defined health as an emergent property of life, and having argued that it’s an emergent property we ought to care about (a lot), there is a certain implication that, although seemingly self-evident, carries with it some implications of its own that aren’t. The first implication is that life is Good. Not just good, as in something that’s kinda nice or goes well with oat milk, but Good, as in something of genuine metaphysical significance, of cosmic value, thereby worthy of capitalisation. American philosophers Drake and Future, I’ll argue, got it right. Life is indeed Good.  <br></br><br></br>

While there is nothing on the face of this that seems even remotely controversial or philosophically interesting, if we accept this premise or axiom, as I suggest we should, we must then defend the position that, not only is life Good, it is something that we must defend/promote/cultivate. To do so, I argue, is our fundamental moral duty. Again, this all seems fine. It’s unlikely that the readers philosophical alarm bells are ringing just yet (at least not too loudly). Life is Good, after all! Of course we should look after it, do all we can to encourage it. It’s only when we consider the underside of this claim (its implicit premise), however, that things get a little squirly. That is, that death is Bad. <br></br><br></br>

   Now we have two axioms:
   <br></br><br></br>
	1.	Life is Good.<br></br>
	2.	Death is Bad.
    <br></br><br></br>
	As a syllogism:
    <br></br><br></br>
Life is good. <br></br>
The opposite of life is death.<br></br>
Therefore, death is bad. 
<br></br><br></br>
By the very laws (or logic) of logic, we cannot have one without the other. It’s a two-for-one kind of deal, you see. For if the opposite of life is death, and life is Good, then - by way of logic - death must be Bad. And yet, while we all seem to buy the first axiom, very few of us are willing to buy the second. When asked whether or not we think immortality would be a good deal, something we’d take if given the chance, surprisingly few answer in the affirmative. Life is Good, but ‘too much of a Good thing’ seems to be the intuition. This is interesting. But the question is, is it defensible (morally or otherwise)? Does this intuition represent some form of higher wisdom that’s latent in the deep structures of the human mind, wisdom that goes beyond human/mortal logic? Or, is it like the rest of our intuitions, merely a heuristic shaped by the caprices of our evolutionary history? An ultimately mistaken notion that will, eventually, be dissolved by the light of knowledge? 
<br></br><br></br>
Before we get to that point in our inquiry, however, we must first get clear as to what we mean by life. In defining life, we will also define death, for it is against life that we must define death. Then, we will look to examine the basis of our intuitive sense that death is a perfectly natural phenomenon and therefore perfectly fine, rather than something to be avoided/overcome. In so doing, I hope to convince the reader that, contrary to this intuition, death really is Bad and thus indeed something to be avoided at all rational cost. <br></br><br></br>
