      <p className={styles.content}>
      Imagine that, for the modest sum of $99, you could purchase a wearable device (a special sort of hat) that configured your brain in such a way that you were “fully Enlightened” so long as you were wearing it. No longer would you have to muster the motivation for meditation, struggle away on the cushion for hours, pour over the pages of dharma books or abstain from sense pleasures. For $99, you could transcend the psychosis of ordinary awareness, along with all its attendant suffering. Sounds like a good deal, no? But would you take it? Should you take it? Even though Enlightenment for double digit dollars is, on the surface, a ripper deal - it’s not clear that we ought to go for it. At least intuitively, Enlightenment seems all of a sudden far less valuable if you can buy it. For is it not the sacrifice inherent in the path, the immense discipline one must cultivate in order to walk it, that makes the goal - should we happen to attain it - so tasty? The same goes for every other element of health. Is it as meaningful if it comes for free (or close to)? Or must it be hard fought? Is it the struggle that makes the success, in other words? <br></br><br></br>

No. The struggle is not what makes the success, though it might sometimes be a bonus. To the degree to that struggle contributes to the well-being that results from “success”, whether that be in terms Enlightenment or any other pursuit, it’s a good thing. However, though the struggle may colour the well-being, or contribute to it, it’s not the primary source of well-being - it’s not what makes the well-being valuable/meaningful. Well-being is what we ultimately care about, not what surrounds it, not the means by which we get there - or what we must sacrifice for it. To illustrate this point, imagine two writers whose strongest yearning in life is to become a successful, widely read author. Further, imagine that their circumstances are precisely the same. For all intents and purposes, their journeys are the same, paved with the same set of challenges etc. In the end, they both achieve their aim, whereafter they both realise immense well-being as a result. However, where one of them suffered throughout the process - found the writing a great hardship, the promotion insufferable etc. - where the other found the whole deal a great delight. Would we opt for the former purely because of the juxtaposition between the experience of the struggle and that of the success? No. We would be crazy to. For on net, if we assume their well-being was the same following their success, the one who “enjoyed the journey” would have led a more “valuable” life. <br></br><br></br>

As for the Enlightenment deal, specifically, it’s much the same. What makes Enlightenment valuable is the well-being that’s inherent in it, the states of mind that it confers upon the “Enlightened”, as well as the ripple-effect that Enlightened individuals tend to have on the world. That the attainment of Enlightenment - to the degree that such a state of finality exists -tends to involve countless hours of practice and immense sacrifice is, for the most part, entirely arbitrary, a product of the vagaries of history. The time, effort, struggle, and discipline that are ordinarily required to produce Enlightenment are not essential qualities of Enlightenment, necessary pre-conditions. In fact, they (their absence) are generally the greatest impediments to Enlightenment. That Enlightenment should require so much of us precludes so many from ever tasting the rainbow. And that’s a great shame. If we could do something about that, we should. 
<br></br><br></br>
One needs not posit the existence of magical technologies, such as the Enlightenment device, in order to challenge our assumptions about the role of effort/discipline along the Path. Indeed, real/non-hypothetical technologies will also do the trick. Think about meditation apps. Their explicit aim is to make meditation “easier”. By serving as a mindfulness alarm, meditation apps can help maximise the time we are spending “actually meditating” and less time simply lost in thought. In some sense, this makes one’s meditation more efficient, and in a sense, easier. Where meditation apps can have a more leveraged impact, however, is in pointing out certain instructions or insights that could have profound and disproportionate effects on the meditator. It’s therefore entirely possible that a quality meditation app could greatly reduce the time it takes one to reach Enlightenment. Does this make it Bad? Should we prefer the path where we struggle blindly on our own? Of course not. All of these technologies that serve our practice exist on a continuum, with the original Enlightenment technology (the Guru) on one end, and the $99 Enlightenment on the other. There is no point along the continuum at which helpful becomes a hinderance, Good becomes Bad. We want Enlightenment as efficiently and painlessly as we can get it. 
<br></br><br></br>
It’s also worth noting that - apparently - some of the greatest sages/gurus throughout history did not endure any suffering whatsoever in order to realise Enlightenment. Instead, they sorta just woke up like that. It’s as if, entirely out of the blue, they were struck with the bolt of Enlightenment. Such individuals have inspired enormous followings and - apparently - affected great change in the lives of others. Interestingly, we don’t devalue such people’s experience or suggest it’s meaningless because they didn’t work for their fruits. On the contrary, we praise them as supranormal beings - special - and flock to them.
