      One of the more interesting, and certainly less considered, aspects of the enhancement debate is the significance of traditional human values, such as discipline, motivation, ambition, work ethic, in a world wherein we have something approaching near-complete mastery over our condition. In other words, is a world wherein we don’t have to endure struggle, suffering, hardship in order to accomplish, a world we should care to inhabit? <br></br><br></br>

Life is Dukkha (suffering/unsatisfactoriness), the Buddha fammously said. It is, he believed, our default condition. Anyone who has lived long enough should be capable of attesting to the Buddha’s insight. Our lives, it’s true, tend to be characterised by a gnawing sense of discontent, dissatisfaction, disappointment. Fortunately, this condition is occasionally punctuated by moments of complete contentment, bliss, euphoria, wholeness. But for the most part, we tend to lean into the next moment, craving something other than whatever it is we’re experiencing in the present. Interestingly, however, in the grand scheme of our lives - at least when they’re considered retrospectively - we tend to view our suffering/Dukkha, not in morbid or negative terms, but as the source of immense meaning in our lives. Our struggle, it seems, is utterly inseparable from our success; our pain intimately connected to our pleasure.<br></br><br></br>

Even if you’re not inclined towards a yin-yang metaphysic (good is bad and bad is good etc.), it’s clear that whatever suffering is, it’s not wholly bad. Just think, what satisfaction would there be in succeeding without some amount of suffering. What’s the point of striving, in other words, if there isn’t great odds to be overcome. Indeed, without great odds to be overcome, there can be no striving. For without striving, there is only success (or failure). And where’s the fun, not to mention meaning, in that? <br></br><br></br>

In fact, it’s this existential condition of Dukkha that, perhaps above everything, binds us as human beings. It’s our shared trauma, the battle scars of our humanity, that’s the ultimate source of our solidarity. Well, trauma and love - but mostly trauma. On this view, suffering is an inexorable part of our human identity, the pain and torment we experience an integral component of the human struggle. More than that, though, not only is suffering inexorable from our identity, it’s of fundamental moral significance. For perhaps it’s in our grappling with suffering that we ultimately discover who we are, in our vulnerability that we learn character, in our contending with the shadow-world that we find meaning, strength, and value. Without suffering there would be no hero’s journey to embark on, for there would be no adversity to overcome, no great battle that infuses our lives with purpose. A hero needs an adversary, after all. Without an adversary, he/she/they/it is just plain regular. So although a life would be less painful without suffering, perhaps it would also be meaningless. <br></br><br></br>

This raises the concern that, were we to engineer suffering out of the human system, would we not have lost one of our most valuable features? Of course, this concern is closely related to authenticity. However, as it has more to do with the metaphysics of suffering, specifically, it deserves its own treatment.<br></br><br></br>

It was the Buddha who said life is Dukkha, so it only makes sense to examine what he thought we should do about it. Although he recognised that Dukkha was a characteristic feature of human life, the Buddha really wasn’t about that Dukkha life. In fact, the whole Enlightenment program he championed was designed specifically to help us transcend this supposedly sad state of affairs. Life is Dukkha, he reckoned, only when we are ignorant, when we fail to see things clearly for what they are. Through practice, namely meditation, we could learn to clarify our perception of things and therefore learn to live above Dukkha, in the peace/tranquility/freedom of true awareness - Nirvana. 
<br></br><br></br>
While it’s easy to wax romantic about the existential value of suffering, it’s important not to take it too far. Without doubt, suffering often is a source of immense value in our lives. It’s through the window of Dukkha that so many discover the Dharma, after all. That said, it seems clear that the vast majority of our suffering - the more mundane, moment-to-moment variety defined by unsatisfactoriness, anxiety, displeasure etc. - is absolutely meaningless, serving no ultimate or larger purpose. On our deathbeds, it’s hard to imagine ourselves reflecting on how meaningful our incessant, gnawing social anxiety was, or the cosmic significance of our never truly liking ourselves, of the self-loathing that plagues so much of our experience. 
<br></br><br></br>
Clearly, there’s good and bad suffering. Suffering that’s ultimately valuable, that leads to our betterment, and suffering that’s just plain ol’ suffering and nothing more. Suffering is not a Good in itself, in other words. It’s only good when it affects a certain kind of response. And so it is that we should embrace the good kind, and do all we can do avoid the bad kind, to expunge as much pointless suffering from our lives as possible.     
<br></br><br></br>
Now what about difficulty? Although closely related, difficulty and suffering are not the same thing. Difficulty can of course be a form of suffering. Take the difficulty often inherent in juggling the affairs of life. Kids, work, attempting to maintain some semblance of a social life etc. Difficulty can also be the source of great satisfaction, not only retrospectively but in the moment, too. Solving a tricky puzzle or attempting a particular gymnastic feat, whatever. There can be both pleasure and pain in difficulty, depending on the framing. Both can be valuable, of course. Difficulty that bears suffering can be good, if it breeds resiliency/grit/discipline or other traits that come in handy down the line. It can also provide satisfaction retrospectively, when we reflect on the challenges of our lives and they provide us with some sense of accomplishment and meaning. Like certain kinds of suffering, though, certain kinds of difficulty contain no value whatsoever. As with certain kinds of difficulty as with bad sex, it’s hard to find any consolation for it. Conversely, difficulty that confers in-the-moment pleasure is of course free from suffering entirely. Though the task at hand might be inherently difficult, the phenomenology of the task is one of satisfaction, pleasure, happiness etc. Obviously, we should keep this kind of difficulty in our lives. 
<br></br><br></br>
In a perfect world, we would develop the capacity to eliminate all unnecessary/meaningless suffering and difficulty from our lives. To do so would be an enhancement. This is an easy enough call to make. All suffering/difficulty that is unequivocally Bad we should remove from the human equation. All that is Good we should keep. Where it gets trickier, however, is in evaluating whether or not we should eliminate suffering/difficulty even if we could not do so discriminately. Provided the chance, should we eliminate all suffering and difficulty so as to secure all the well-being that would fill its place? Or, should we prefer our lives as they currently are, that is, a sloppy mix of the two? 
<br></br><br></br>
There are two thought experiments that help illuminate the dilemma here. The first is a device that confers total Enlightenment upon whoever uses it. The second, a neural implant that enables us to download knowledge/skills instantaneously, without effort.
