      One of the first issues people have with enhancement is the concept itself. Sure, enhancement implies an improvement in what we are, but what exactly constitutes an improvement? Presumably, what one person might consider an enhancement, another might consider a downgrade. This has less to do with the fact that some humans are better philosophers than others, and more to do with the fact that we are all constituted slightly differently; we all have unique preferences, things we like or value more than others. While super-intelligence sounds like a dream to some, it could conceivably sound like a curse to others. So how are we to reconcile this variance, in terms of taste, that defines our species? If we can’t converge on what changes to make to ourselves, is society not destined to fracture at the seams? <br></br><br></br>

In some sense, this is the flip side of the unintended consequences concern. Rather than ‘what if we fuck it up?’, this class of concern has to do with ‘what if we get it right?’ One of the major concerns is that, given the hyper-competitive nature of our present culture, the kinds of enhancements we’re likely to make are bound to be skewed towards traits or attributes that simply make us more competitive, as opposed to genuinely ‘better’ human beings. Within the context of our current cultural paradigm, intelligence, discipline, obedience, model good looks, are the kinds of features we’re likely to optimise for, provided the chance. However, whether this is the kind of society we should strive for is questionable. While the concern that economic factors (and thus values) will determine the kinds of enhancements we’re likely to make - rather than more ‘enlightened’ values - is well-founded, the real issue is in fact far deeper. The concern, construed more broadly, is that we are not in a place - culturally/intellectually - to make decisions that could so materially affect the trajectory of our species. Since the enhancements we’re likely to make will invariably reflect the values of our present culture, if our values are perverted in fundamental ways, then such enhancements will only further pervert our being. 
<br></br><br></br>
This problem has also been framed, rather less cynically, as a lack of imagination issue. As in, the kinds of enhancements are likely to be narrowly focused by virtue of the fact that we lack the capacity to imagine things that might be desirable, either now or in the future. An example that’s provided is that of creative genius. Imagine we were we granted, in the 19th century, the ability to enhance our musical abilities. Provided the chance, we would have enhanced our music-making abilities according to our then-existent criteria as to what constitutes good music. Alas, we would have engineered generations of better classical musicians, new-and-improved Bach’s and Beethoven’s. Consequently, we wouldn’t have gotten the Beatles, nor Biggie. For in order to get the Beatles or Biggie it would’ve require our having conceived of their work, and its desirability, before their existence.<br></br><br></br>

Although these concerns are generally presented as arguments against enhancement, it’s worth appreciating that they could just as readily be framed as arguments for enhancement. In the first case, the problem of the relationship between values and enhancement, we might use this line of reasoning to advocate for enhancing our value systems before anything else. In the case of imagination, this suggests that enhancing our imaginations might also be a good thing. 
<br></br><br></br>
In any case, both arguments represent valid concerns. However, they’re also simply immutable realities of the human condition. Our value systems are as a matter of fact imperfect, and our imaginations all too constrained by circumstance. To say that we should rally against enhancement, on either basis, would be a mistake. We’ve been enhancing - or at least editing - culture with imperfect - that is, human - value systems and limited imaginations since day one. It therefore seems unreasonable that we should all of a sudden demand higher standards of ourselves before we go on doing the same. Whether or not perfect values and unbounded imaginations would be ideal, the fact is we don’t have them - and likely never will. We are human beings, with all that entails. We make decisions, everyday, based on incomplete information, with limited intelligence, and value systems shaped by our own set of arbitrary experiences. It’s therefore unreasonable to hold society to standards that we don’t even hold ourselves to, and couldn’t even if we wanted to. 
<br></br><br></br>
Theoretical arguments aside, it’s inevitable that we will continue to enhance - or attempt to enhance - ourselves before we reach anything close to perfection. On purely pragmatic grounds, our focus should thus not be on whether or not we should do so, in light of our imperfection, but rather how/if we can prevent our imperfection from getting the best of us, whether there are systematic ways we can ensure the better angels of our nature are expressed, and not our worse demons.
<br></br><br></br>
Although it’s alarming to consider the worst elements of our present culture being amplified in the name of ‘enhancement’, perhaps the most important aspect - and indeed controllable - of all of this, is that we retain the freedom to decide our individual futures. See, part of what makes us so anxious about the future of enhancement is the thought of someone else deciding, on our behalf, what’s good. This notion conflicts with one of our most deeply held intuitions. That is, that our lives are for us - as individuals - to decide, the freedom to fuck up our own future our most cherished, fundamental right. If we are going to fuck our future’s up, we’ll do it on our own, thank you very much. 
<br></br><br></br>
It’s thus the lack of freedom, not the enhancements per se, that make dystopian futures - such as Brave New World - so, well, dystopian. We want the right to shape our own destiny, to decide for ourselves what’s good, what’s worth enhancing and what’s not. Given the state-space of possible and desirable futures, there are many enhancements one might choose. What we must work towards, therefore, is ensuring this state-space remains vast, that we respect the right to choose, for ourselves, the sorts of enhancements we consider worth embodying. What we must prevent is the collapse of possible futures into a singular and homogenous world, devoid of physiological/psychological diversity. So long as an enhancement is compatible with the well-being of others, in the broadest sense, we should welcome it. It’s not for us to impose our own cup of tea on others. If someone wants giant biceps or 6 hands, power to them. Morphological freedom, my friends.
