      As much as the implications of the enhancement conversation extend well beyond the ivory tower of academia, much of the conversation is indeed purely academic (or at least close to). Whether you think enhancement is a good idea or the worst, as a matter of principle, is one thing. It’s entirely another translating these positions into real-world actions or governmental policy. How, for instance, should the belief in the moral value of human enhancement impact our approach to the job? Dial down regulations, perhaps? Let the scientists go hell for leather? Put more money towards basic research? Conversely, what would it mean, in terms of the regulations we might seek to implement, if we decide enhancement is a fundamentally bad idea? Shut down biology? Prevent the sale of anything that intends or purports to makes us better? Or what?
<br></br><br></br>
This part of the conversation opens up a can of worms, philosophically speaking. A can of worms that, to be honest, I have very little interest in opening. That can of worms - as you might have guessed - is the role of government regulation. For what its worth, my personal bias is against regulation almost across the board (full disclaimer). That said, I’m perfectly open to the idea that regulation may in some instances be of value, though it’s hard to say where (or when). Aside from the odd libertarian, God bless their souls, very few people challenge the supposed utility of regulation. Indeed, it’s simply assumed that regulation is synonymous with good sense. Regulation is good, regulation makes us safe, regulation is an insurance policy. Regulation appeals to our desire for order, security, safety. There is obvious psychological appeal to the notion that, through legislation, we can control the future. Whether or not government regulation is ever called for, or of genuine value on net, the challenge associated with regulation is in regulating, so as to achieve the desired outcome - be it safety, justice etc. - without fucking other shit up, whether basic rights or scientific progress or technological innovation. The problem with regulation, as with enhancement, is the problem of unintended consequences. 
<br></br><br></br>
Most regulation, perhaps the overwhelming majority, is merely the pretence of control. That is, it doesn’t materially change behaviour in the desired direction but simply gives us something to point to when asked what we’re doing to prevent x from happening. This sounds harmless, although it often comes at great expense, whether in terms of what it costs governments (and thus the populations which support them) or stifled innovation. Given the stupendous complexity of things, it’s impossibly difficult to know, with any real certainty, the consequences of any given regulation. As with biological interventions, regulatory interventions are dealing with highly complex, non-linear open systems that are by their nature highly unpredictable. What seems like a perfectly sound, intuitive idea - such as placing controls on certain kinds of behaviour - often manifests in the form of highly adverse and yet absolutely unforeseen consequences. It’s revealing that the most regulated industries in the US, education and health care, are also the most dysfunctional, sclerotic. Just as we ought to be worried about our ability to make enhancements to ourselves, without disastrous unintended consequences, we ought to be worried about our ability to successfully regulate the systems that will mediate future enhancements. We can be sure we will try, but we can be far from sure we’ll succeed. 
<br></br><br></br>
With respect to enhancement technology, specifically, it’s terribly difficult to imagine how we might go about regulation. Short of pulling funding for all relevant scientific research, which would be both unprecedented and unmanageable (from an administrative standpoint),[ The same basic insights that would lead to enhancements are also likely to lead to cures for cancer. ] it’s not clear what could be done to prevent the inevitability that is human enhancement. Though we might keep in place our moratorium on germ-line interventions, such a policy is in reality arbitrary. Whether to make germ-line vs somatic interventions is, for the most part, a matter of convenience. If it makes sense to intervene at the level of the germ-line, provided the legal permission, we will. Otherwise, we’ll do the thing somatically. 
<br></br><br></br>
Part of the issue with regulating enhancement is the competitive dynamics that come into play. What one country allows, another won’t. For those that are more liberal in terms of regulation, it’s easy to imagine there being a certain competitive advantage that such nations will gain. Remember, an enhancement is something that, by definition, makes us better. So long as what we define as constituting “better” continues to accord with our economic aims, nations that take a more lenient stance towards enhancements will be benefited. So even though the US, for instance, might draw a line in the sand against a particular enhancement, if their Chinese friends are going hard on that enhancement and that enhancement seems to be working, it’s hard to see the US remaining firm in their position, on “moral grounds”. When it’s all said and done, nations will do whatever they deem to be in their best interest. Abstract moral concerns will quickly seem quaint/irrelevant in the face of a compelling economic incentive. Should that give us pause? Of course. Is there anything we can do about it? Probably not. The future is coming, whether one likes it or not.
