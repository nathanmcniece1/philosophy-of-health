      Antiquity was littered with such schools. At the heart of each of them was the concept of a ‘philosophy of life,’ that is, a view of what constitutes the ‘Good Life’, and how it’s to be attained. While there is no bumper sticker version of Plato’s philosophy of life, his allegory of the cave serves as some approximation of what it might’ve been: that the end of human life is to escape the cave of ignorance in which we are all born, and emerge, through diligent study, into the light of wisdom. Enlightenment, in a word. Others were more explicit. Antisthenes, a student of Socrates, for instance, founded the Cynic school of philosophy, which advocated an ascetic lifestyle. Discipline. Conversely, Aristippus, another student of Socrates, promoted a hedonistic lifestyle. Pleasure. In between these two extremes, were the Epicurean, Skeptic and Stoic schools, each which advocated different philosophical recipes for the Good Life. Where the Academy was at once highly theoretical and grounded in the practical affairs of human life, many of the subsequent schools were skewed more towards the practical, with the Cynics eschewing theory almost entirely. <br></br><br></br>

“The thing is, though,” Leonard said, still staring in the waitress’s direction, “I didn’t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn to die, et cetera. Now it’s more like, ‘What do we mean when we say we die?’ ‘What do we mean we mean when we say we die?

There are no longer such philosophical schools. Today, philosophy is almost solely the province of the Ivory Tower, academia, and has become almost entirely divorced, with little exception, from the practical reality of human life, the concept of a ‘philosophy of life’ having long gone out of fashion. While the shift towards the purely theoretical dimension of the philosophical game was perhaps an inevitable consequence of the institutionalisation of philosophy and the growth of knowledge generally, it remains a great shame that the practical piece - that is, the piece that most concerns most people - has fallen by the wayside. <br></br><br></br>

    <em>
	“Among most of the philosophers of antiquity there was a close connection between 		a view of the universe and a doctrine as to the best way of life… If philosophy is to 		play a serious part in the lives of men who are not specialists, it must not cease to 		advocate some way of life. In doing this it is seeking to do something of what religion 		has done, but with certain differences. The greatest difference is that there is no 		appeal to authority, whether that of tradition or that of a sacred book.”<br></br><br></br>

The institutionalisation or academification of philosophy has had a number effects on the enterprise, beyond the gradual erosion of its practical foundation. Not the least of which is the trend towards obscurantism and obfuscation, a trend perhaps most flagrantly embodied by the philosophical movement known as “post-modernism.” Born out of the existentialist tradition - another philosophical movement infamous for its amorphousness and resonance with adolescent angst - post-modernism sought to undermine all claims at truth, claims to truth being ultimately claims to power. The idea, in a nutshell, was that all truth is relative, dependent upon cultural context for its validity, that nothing is therefore inherently real or true in any ultimate sense. Sex, gender, politics, morality, Reality writ small and large, it’s all constructed, all made up. That’s post-modernism, in a sentence. Of course, it’s not without irony that post-modernists were making truth claims of their own (with the passionate zeal of relativism) in order to undermine all other truth claims, but that’s another thing. The point here is that post-modernism is reflective, as well as a proximate cause, of a certain decay within the philosophical enterprise at large. A decay that sees inaccessibility pegged as virtue, the impenetrability of a work hailed as proof of its genius. In other words, the insidious rot of pretentiousness has brought the promise of philosophy to its knees. 
<br></br><br></br>

Whatever value there is to post-modernist thought, whatever its genuine contribution, and I’m convinced there must be some, it’s most visible function is as a disguise for intellectual sloppiness, a seemingly catch-all justification for every flavour of ill-conceived idea. ‘It’s not stupid, it’s post-modern. As in, after modern. It’s like philosophy but, like, from the future. You wouldn’t get it.’ Even if the movement has served as a much-needed corrective against overconfidence, convention and cherished dogma, a potentially valid argument one might make, the memes that arose from it have perversely affected the health of society’s intellectual dialogue, in more ways than one. In glorifying concepts such as ambiguity, uncertainty, relativity, and subjectivity, and in doing so in such overtly non-sensical fashion, post-modernism promotes a malaise of ambivalence, by sowing an almost malicious distrust in the very integrity of the philosophical project, the project of Knowledge. 
<br></br><br></br>

While post-modernism is a microcosm of the worst of modern philosophy and therefore an easy target for criticism, it is by and large but a reflection of the structural - that is, institutional - conditions that gave rise to it. As a product of academia, modern philosophy has been imbued with its myriad biases and prejudices, not only structural and intellectual, but aesthetic, too.[ To be sure, obscurantism and the pretence of profundity is not confined to Western philosophy. One need only skim the surface of Eastern philosophy to realise it’s just as bad, if not worse. ] The social, cultural and psychological dynamics of modern academia, both good and bad, have inevitably been projected upon the enterprise of thought. In addition to a spirit of critical thinking and scholarly rigour, philosophy has been suffused with group-think, a propensity for jargon, an affinity for the highfalutin, the pretence of profundity, as well as a bias towards pure theory. None of this should be revelatory, for thought and the conditions of thought are of course inextricable. If something is awry with the former, so too must there be with the latter. 
<br></br><br></br>

All of this simply to say that a wedge of artifice has been placed between the practice of philosophy and everyday human life. And since the value of philosophy is ultimately in its bearing upon everyday human life, this represents somewhat of a tragedy.
