      A philosophy of life, for it to qualify as even half-way sensible, must be capable of reliably improving the lives of those who adhere to it. Ideally, such a philosophy would also be equally actionable at both the individual and societal levels. For the quality of our lives is not only determined by the way in which we orient ourselves in the world, but also the very architecture of the world itself. After all, we don’t live in a vacuum. Rather, we live in the world; a world we stumbled into by happenstance and now find ourselves playing an active role in shaping. And it’s the quality of the relationship between ourselves and the design of this world that is the quality of our lives. Thus the ideal philosophy of life would be one that effectively improves this relationship at both ends. The philosophy of life that is humanity’s present default, a kind of hedonistic materialism with humanist shading, it seems safe to say, is some way from ideal. As effective as it’s been, bringing us out of the dark ages, affecting progress on almost all fronts, its inadequacies and deficiencies have been made blatantly apparent. Accordingly, humanity needs a new orientation. One that retains what is working within our present system but fills the cracks, too. So what’s the alternative? Well, it’s hard to imagine Enlightenment becoming the target of civilisation, for better or worse. What about well-being? Seems obvious enough, no? After all, that’s what really matters, right? The trouble with well-being, as an orientation, is that it’s already implicit in almost every philosophical system. Hedonism thinks hedonism is the way to go because it’s the most effective means of creating well-being (however narrowly defined) — not because it runs counter to it. Same deal with Enlightenment. Same with economic materialism. So well-being is already central to humanity’s efforts, in other words. To rally for well-being is therefore to assert the obvious. The trouble is not that well-being is entirely absent from the discussion, rather it’s that humanity’s present philosophy is held to be the most effective at producing it — and historically, that’s correct. To come along and pronounce that GDP is an inadequate measure of things, that there is more to life than economic prosperity, that it’s well-being that matters, is bound to fall on deaf ears. Not for lack of sympathy, but for lack of insight. Of course GDP is inadequate. And of course well-being is what really matters. However, when GDP has proven itself to be such an effective target, as it has, moving the needle of almost every dial, when economic growth has long served as such a reliable proxy for every kind of improvement, one must bring more to the table than mere self-evident declarations. One must provide a substitute that is both as actionable as GDP and compatible with it; a new orientation that throws out the bath water but keeps the baby. Well-being, however, is not a substitute for economic growth. Economic growth is an engine of well-being, albeit a highly imperfect one. Well-being is not an engine of well-being. Indeed it is the thing itself; the end rather than the means. What we need, therefore, is a new and reliable means — a technology for generating human flourishing — that extends beyond the limitations of economic growth. Enter, health. 

      <br></br><br></br>

As I’ll attempt to persuade, health — not happiness, nor pleasure, nor economic growth, nor Enlightenment, nor even well-being — is the most powerful psychological-philosophical orientation; the most reliable guide to the good life, the most expansive, the most actionable, and above all, the most grounded in what it actually is to be human. While the importance of health is generally acknowledged, at least superficially, the way in which we live, and the way in which we’ve structured the world, reveals how little we truly appreciate its primacy. We pay lip service to the idea of health, yet undermine it with almost every action. Why? Much of the problem, I’ll argue, is a function of our individual and collective ignorance of health as a philosophical concept and physical reality. Our thinking is ordinarily shallow, charged with cultural associations, rife with misconceptions, simply mistaken. However, that we don’t sufficiently understand or appreciate health, as a thing, is far from perplexing. On the contrary, it’s entirely natural and unsurprising given where we come from, the evolutionary and historical roads that have led us to this point. Correcting this oversight — ameliorating this particular branch of ignorance — I hope to convince, is among the most important and consequential things we can do to improve our individual and collective fait. And the first step, it seems, is to remove health from the shell of banality and obviousness that so disguises its substance, and to place it under the light of critical inspection. Once we understand it, we can then appreciate it. Once we appreciate it, we can then embody it. And once we’ve embodied it, we’ve done our job.
