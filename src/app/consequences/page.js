      Philosophical quibbling aside, there is a genuine concern that underlies the authenticity thing. That is, that in attempting to enhance ourselves, according to some conception of what’s good, we could really fuck things up. For instance, in engineering for heightened intelligence, we may well lose other, and perhaps more important qualities - such as empathy, compassion, love. Whatever this has or hasn’t to do with authenticity, it’s a valid concern nonetheless. We want to enhance ourselves, after all, not mess our shit up. This is among the most significant concerns with human enhancement - and engineering more broadly. It’s the problem of unintended consequences. We want one thing, and unwittingly get another. Unintended consequences are a fundamental problem inherent to intervening in the human experiment. It’s also a fundamental problem, however, with not intervening in the human experiment. There are consequences to both our actions and non-actions, and given the stupid complexity of things, some of those consequences are inevitably unanticipated. Moreover, some unanticipated consequences are also undesirable. Not everything is roses. At least not all the time. <br></br><br></br>

There are innumerable examples of unintended consequences of human engineering. That millions of people would some day die as a result of the invention of cars was unlikely anticipated by Henry Ford when he was tinkering on his first model automobile. That social media would be weaponised, lead to an information apocalypse - the “infocalypse” - dividing society and undermining the concept of truth was probably not top of Zuckerberg’s mind as he was hacking away at “The Facebook” in his Harvard dorm. Similarly, that the efficient combustion of fossil fuels would eventually lead to runaway climate change was, at the dawn of the industrial revolution, probably unthinkable. And yet…
<br></br><br></br>
While it’s easy to cast judgment on such characters of history, label them ignorant, or worse, malevolent, the reality is that the future is tricky. Shit happens, and our powers of foresight are all too limited. That’s the issue here, not “authenticity”. We are stupid apes with the god-like powers. What could possibly go wrong? We’ll just make a harmless edit to the germ-line here, tweak our immune system just a touch. It’ll be sweet, promise. Next minute we’re all zombies. So no wonder we’re nervous. The unsettling truth is that this is the game we’re playing. And it’s the game we’ve been playing for a good while. The even more unsettling truth, however, is it’s not all that clear what - if anything - we can do about it. We can encourage caution, “play it safe”, but just what effect - if at all - that has on things is far from obvious. 
<br></br><br></br>
Before we get to that point, though, there’s still much to cover. For instance, what if we get it right? What if it all works out according to plan? Who’s plan?
