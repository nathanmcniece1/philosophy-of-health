      <p className={styles.content}>
      magine a neural implant (a chip inside your brain) that allowed you to download any knowledge/skill for the price of an iPhone app. We’ll call it the “Learnomade” (like lemonade but with learn LOL). Want to speak fluent French? A couple of clicks and you’re good to go. Keen to master the karma sutra? Not a problem - 99 cents and you’ll be pretzeling like a pro in no time. Surf like Kelly Slater? Easy. With the Learnomade at your aid, no longer would you have to slave away for years in order to acquire knowledge or master a skill. At last, the world would be your oyster, your wildest dreams realised - and all in an instant. <br></br><br></br>

Yay or nay? Would such a technology be a: the very best thing to happen to the world, or b: the worst thing since COVID-19? <br></br><br></br>

On one hand, what a gift it would be. Not only would the horizon of our possible experiences expand almost infinitely, civilisation in the large would be utterly transformed. The intellectual/temporal band-width constraints that have so long capped our potential would be no more. Technologies hitherto unimaginable would be discovered, enabling us to solve the technical challenges of our time. Presumably, our lives would be made all the richer by our newfound capabilities and the vast reams of knowledge we would have, not only at our fingertips, but literally inside our skulls. Moreover, it stands to reason that such a technology could - and more than likely would - improve our humanity, at least in certain ways. After all, wisdom - that most elusive human thing - is a certain kind of knowledge, one that - with the Learnomade - we could readily download like any other. To the degree that wisdom improves lives, this would be of immense benefit. And talk about equal opportunity! Such a technology would, at least in principle, be the ultimate equaliser. At last, the meritocratic ideal would be realised.  <br></br><br></br>

On the flip-side, what’s the point of things in a world any-one can do any-thing? All of the fear, excitement, anticipation, struggle, satisfaction - in a word, humanity - that surrounds the learning process would be extinguished. In its place would be left only the intrinsic qualities of any given activity. Speaking French would feel like speaking French, at least on some level, but it would not contain the additional richness of humanity that is imbued in the act by learning it by ordinary - non-magical - means. 
<br></br><br></br>
As awesome as such a superpower would be, the concern - in a nutshell - is that we would in exchange be trading something far more valuable - our humanity. This intuition/argument represents a large class of concern re the ethics of human enhancement. That is, that certain kinds of enhancement would be “de-humanizing” and therefore Bad. De-humanizing arguments are interesting, for they rest on a particular conception of human nature along with the view that What We Are is What We Ought to Be/remain. Broadly speaking, the idea is that we are creatures that love, hate, struggle, suffer, laugh, fight, forgive - i.e. do all the human things - and we should keep things that way. To intervene on ourselves to the point that we fundamentally alter our nature would, it goes, be highly unethical - on the basis of our “human nature” being something that’s a Good in and of itself. 
<br></br><br></br>
Such arguments are not new. Something of the sort apparently drove the Celtic warriors to eschew body amor (and even clothing) in battle because they believed that it diminished the glory of a true victory. Armor, it was believed, somehow stifled the humanity of the experience of war. More modern examples also abound. For instance, some authors have argued that computer keyboards corrupt the humanity writing process, driving a wedge between our humanness and the page. Such examples are generally provided in order to demonstrate how ridiculous de-humanizing concerns are in practice. “See, all the fears of how technology would violate our essential humanness, throughout history, have been mostly unfounded”. The kind of character traits we cherish and admire in ourselves are very rarely smothered by new - and at first, seemingly magical - technologies, they simply reveal themselves in new ways, in new struggles. 
<br></br><br></br>
Perhaps the same would go for the Learnomade. While the struggle and satisfaction involved in the learning process will have been done with, maybe there would be a whole new frontier of struggle and satisfaction - suffering and well-being - that the Learnomade opens up. Perhaps, in a post-learning world, the primary human endeavour would no longer be the acquisition of skills/traits/knowledge, but instead the creation of entirely new kinds. Having mastered the known, perhaps we would set our sights solely on the unknown. The struggle and satisfaction that was once part-and-parcel of the learning process would, perhaps, find itself replaced by the struggle and satisfaction inherent in the process of creation. 
<br></br><br></br>
So maybe the Learnomade would be continuous with the history of technological things that change the way we do things. Like the rest of things, the Learnomade would change things, but not our nature. It would not de-humanize us, so much as re-humanize us; that is, redefine what it is to do and be and suffer and prosper as a human being. We would still suffer, don’t worry, just differently. 
<br></br><br></br>

But then again, perhaps not. Perhaps the advent of the Learnomade would represent a fundamental departure from the history of technological progress, an invention so radically powerful that it doesn’t compare to anything that preceded it. Maybe the computer keyboard isn’t a fair analogy for the Learnomade, then, for where the former merely amplifies or augments our nature, the latter makes of it something completely Other. Perhaps. If history tells us anything, however, it’s that our technological fears are very rarely justified. What we identify as cause for concern hardly ever proves to be genuinely problematic. Rather it’s what we don’t identify that bites us in the ass. That’s not to say that technology is never a threat to the quality of our humanity, and thus never worth worrying about. It’s rather to point out that we can only so scarcely grasp, in advance, the ways in which technologies will affect us. We can speculate, but the future is unknown, the world weird, God too funny - and so she laughs at our prophesies.
